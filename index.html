         <p>In 2006, Dr Helen Grzyb was part of the original MRWA Value Assurance Review team which tested the first Value Assurance Review (VAR) of MRWA stakeholder engagement. As a result of this work, Helen is an accredited MRWA VAR Reviewer. Subsequently Helen went on to undertake a further five reviews for MRWA projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Albany Ring Road project</li>
                    <li>City East Alliance project</li>
                    <li>Gateway Vision project</li>
                    <li>Mitchell Freeway Extension project</li>
                </ul>
        <p>Helen is very experienced in undertaking independent reviews including with diverse frameworks and standards. She has developed enhancements to increase outcomes from the review process/result including coaching project staff to increase project engagement expertise.</p>
                
        <p>Currently, as a highly experienced VAR reviewer Helen has utilised the MRWA framework and has adapted review techniques to extend and improve the framework to include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real time evaluation</li>
                    <li>Independent review statement as part of the project business case</li>
                </ul>
        <p>Helen is sought after to share her expertise in organisations such as IAP2 (she is a member) and ISCA (also a member).</p>

                <h6>Project Background</h6>
            
                <p>Established in 1863 at the mouth of the Harding River near Roebourne. Cossack was once a thriving community servicing the pastoral and pearling industries.</p>
            
                <p>Originally known as Tien Tsin harbour, the name was changed in 1871 to Cossack in honour of the ship that carried the Western Australian Governor Sir Frederick Weld to the area. Pearl divers from Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia were first attracted to the area in 1866 and by the 1870s more than 80 boats were operating out of the port.</p>
            
                <p>The townsite was officially declared in 1872. Such was its commercial importance that by 1887 a horse drawn tramway connected Cossack port with the township of Roebourne. The town was abandoned after World War II following unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate the local pearling industry.</p>
                
                <p>For decades the heritage buildings deteriorated into ruins until new funding permitted restoration work to be undertaken. This funding was sourced from the Heritage Council and supported by funds from the Shire of Roebourne. Connection to power, water and sewerage has been delayed due to lack of a clear future for the site. Tourist operators had gone out of business in the meantime.</p>
                
                <p>With the pressure for increased housing in Karratha, a project was commissioned by the Department of Housing and Works, the Heritage Council of WA and the Shire of Roebourne.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Project Objective</strong>: To develop the best way forward for Cossack including consideration of ways to optimise opportunities for housing.</p>
                
                <strong><p>Goal for Helen Grzyb and Associates:</strong> To engage with the community and with stakeholders for their input into a masterplan.</p>
                <h6><img src="img/cossackmasterplan.jpg" alt="Cossack masterplan document" class="card-image">Image from Cossack Master Plan Palassis Architects</h6>

                <p>Our team members were Dr Grzyb, Shontay Cardew, Mary Power. We identified the key audiences including private landowners; ratepayers (currently partly funding the restoration work), archaeological, heritage, and indigenous groups, as well as federal, state and local governments.</p>
                
                <p>A consultation plan was developed, including six focus groups which were held in Cossack, Roebourne, Karratha, and in Perth.</p>
                
                <p>There was general concurrence about heritage, environmental and climate constraints on increasing buildings at the site.</p>
                
                <p>A draft masterplan was developed and released for comment late in 2006. Further feedback was sought from stakeholders and these comments informed the development of a masterplan which was presented to the Minister for Housing for his consideration.</p>

            <p>Fremantle Prison Heritage Precinct is one of the most significant heritage sites in Australia.</p>
            <p>The development of the Fremantle Prison Heritage Precinct Master Plan presented many exciting opportunities to create an exceptional and viable experience. The success of the Fremantle Prison as a unique heritage precinct is to a large degree reliant on capturing the attention and imagination of visitors. The opportunity now exist to emphasise its connection with the port and city of Fremantle and to provide economically viable and compatible utilisation of the buildings and spaces which make up the precinct.</p>       
            <p>The project was to develop a Master Plan which created a vision for the future, firmly anchored in the past, with practical implementation strategies for the present. Palassis Architects were appointed as the project leaders, with international expertise from tourism, heritage,and marketing included in the multi-disciplinary project team.</p>
            <p>Our engagement team members Dr Grzyb, Amy Lomas, Mary Power, and John Michael Swinbank, brought collective expertise in managing multiple stakeholders, for example managing situations where stakeholders may have aggressively pursued special interests.</p>
           <p> We developed an optimum two stage engagement strategy that involved local and government stakeholders in developing a way forward for the Prison.</p>
           <p>The Master Plan was adopted by government and implemented.</p>

        <h5>Baptistcare 2012</h5>
        <p>In 2012, Helen Grzyb and Associates were appointed to undertake a review of Baptistcare’s contract with the Town of Brookton for management of the Kalkarni Aged Care facility.</p>
        <p>The work involved reviewing documentation including contracts and financial reports, undertaking workshops and meeting with key stakeholders of the residential aged care service as well as the adjacent medical service.</p>
        <p>As a result of this work the contract negotiations between the two parties progressed and an updated contract was agreed which recognised the current operating and policy environment for residential aged care in regional Western Australia; the quality requirements for residential aged care services; the differing needs well as the commonalities of interest between Baptistcare and the Town of Brookton.</p>
